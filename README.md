# Quake Fortress 2
A small Team Fortress 2 inspired mod for Quake 2 Deathmatch

Features of the mod:

- 5 different classes
- 5 random perks you can select
- Reworked Quake 2 weapons into TF2 weapons (flamethrower, rocket jumper, etc.)



How to play mod:

- Just place the mod and shortcut into your Quake 2 folder
- Make sure to copy and put "pak0.pak" within your "tf2-mod" folder
- If shortcut doesn't work just boot up your mod by opening vanilla Q2
- Once the mod is working, create a simple deathmatch game and the mod will do its magic :)

- 5 different classes

       - Once you load into deathmatch you will be asked on screen to 
         choose a class by pressing one of the specified keys
       - Make sure to press the key more than once (sometimes one press will not work)
       - If you would like to change classes press "Y" to view the classes and press another key

- 5 random perks


       - Five random and wacky perks can be rolled by pressing "V"
       - These perks can be: super bullets, infinite ammo, double health,
         explosive bullets, and low health...
       - Each of these perks will last for 15 seconds 
         (but if you span the "V" key you can rotate through them and go crazy :D)
- Reworked Quake 2 weapons into TF2 weapons

       - One of the biggest parts of Team Fortress 2 is the 
         random chance of shooting critical hit bullets, rockets, flames, etc.
       - But for this mod, you will have a small chance of shooting a BFG round as well
       - Just go all over the place with your weapons and you may see one of these critical hits
       
       - Soldier has the "Rocket Jumper": a rocket launcher that shoots 
         no-damage rockets, but gives the soldier great momentum and he has a Super Shotgun.
       - Pyro has the "Flamethrower": a modified machine gun that 
         shoots blazing flames at the opponent
       - Heavy has his standard "Minigun": a chaingun that does 
         massive damage, but it takes a long time to rev up. 
       - Scout has the basic Shotgun.
       - Sniper has the basic Railgun.
